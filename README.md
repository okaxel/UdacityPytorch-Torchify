# Torchify 

## Goal 
The goal of the 'Torchify' is to help students to understand the structure of neural networks better. 
For this our app is designed to offer a visual and a coding help. 


Torchify needs some basic knowledge about Neural Networks, but we recommend it for everyone who learns about 
Neural Networks from beginners to pros. It can be a helpful guide at any stage in you learning process.


## Future plans
In the future we intend to change the followings: 
- run our application on a separate server, where anyone could reach it with a simple link
- give the user the possibility to change activation functions as much as he/she want to 

We would also like to get feedbacks from the users of the first version and improve Torchify accordingly. 

## How to use it 
At the moment you can download the notebook and run the application on your personal network. 

## Requirements

Dash and plotly.
